# linux-install-scipts
Scripts for software, that I personally use in Linux
It's now pretty empty but the scripts will grow over time
07.07.2021 pacman version is stable and I used/wrote when I installed manjaro (I installed it twice because on time I accidentally broke it, whuuuups)
And there is now a new Folder called Commands in which I store my own programs (C++/Shell Scipt) that I use.
